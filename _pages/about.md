👩‍🎓I'm a first year PhD student at the Institute of Global Pandemic Planning at the University of Warwick.

🔬 My research interests are in uncovering the burden of infectious diseases among vulnerable populations and exploring the interplay between social determinants, health inequities, and disease outcomes to inform targeted interventions.

📚 Currently I'm working towards my MPhil modules for the PhD program in the field of Pandemic Response Planning. 

🧰 I'm also interested in exploring new statistical visualization and programming tools! *Confession: You'll always find one tab open on my laptop... and it's probably about a shiny new research technique I just can't get enough of*
